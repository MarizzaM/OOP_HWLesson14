1.Inheritance allows us to define a class in terms of another class, which makes it easier to create and maintain an application. 
  This also provides an opportunity to reuse the code functionality and speeds up implementation time.
  
2. C# allows you to create abstract classes that are used to provide partial class implementation of an interface. 
    Implementation is completed when a derived class inherits from it. 
    Abstract classes contain abstract methods, which are implemented by the derived class. 
    The derived classes have more specialized functionality.
    
3. The word polymorphism means having many forms. 
    In object-oriented programming paradigm, polymorphism is often expressed as 'one interface, multiple functions'.
